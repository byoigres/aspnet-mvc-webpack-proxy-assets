# ASP.NET MVC + Webpack + Hapi + SASS + React + HMR

> You MUST to know the basis about Webpack, ES6 and ESLint to use this project or
you can clone it and follow this README to start learning about it.

## What this project do?

- It's an ASP.NET MVC 5 Project.
- All NuGet packages related to JavaScript and CSS have been removed.
- All the frontend dependencies have been installed using `npm`.
- It have a small `npm` project inside `Content` folder.
- The module bundling works with `webpack`.
- Webpack creates the bundles inside `Content/bundles` directory.
- With razor we can link the bundles from `Content/bundles` directory.
- Webpack creates a small proxy server with hapijs to serve the bundles in developer mode.
- The Hot Module Replacement plugin, reload (and transpile) changes to the browser when they're changed and saved.
- ESLint it's running every moment to check code errors.

## NuGet packages removed from project

All this unnecesary NuGet packages have been removed, we don't need it anymore and in case you do, just run `npm install <package> --save-dev`.

- bootstrap
- jQuery.Validation
- Microsoft.jQuery.Unobtrusive.Validation
- jQuery.Validation
- jQuery
- Respond
- Modernizr

## Directory structure

All the work it's done within the `Content` directory.

```
\---Content
    |   .babelrc
    |   .editorconfig
    |   .eslintignore
    |   .eslintrc
    |   package.json
    |   webpack-dev-server.js
    |   webpack.config.js
    |
    +---bundles
    |
    \---src
        +---entries
        |       home.js
        |       
        \---styles
            |   core.scss
            |   _base.scss
            |   _mixins.scss
            |   
            +---entries
            |       home.scss
            |       
            \---vendor
                    _colors.scss
                    _normalize.scss
```

- `src` folder contains the source, all the project entries and styles that can be configured in `entry` section of `webpack.config.js` file.
- `bundles` is the directory where the bundles will be generated.
- `.babelrc` it's the `babel` configuration file to transpile ES6 code to ES5.
- `.editorconfig` is the configuration for [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org) (in case you use it and you should).
- `.eslintignore` it's the ESLint ignoring list.
- `.eslintrc` it's the ESLint configuration file.
- `webpack-dev-server.js` creates a proxy trough your ASP.NET MVC application and execute webpack in developer mode to generate the output assets.
- `webpack.config.js` it's the `webpack` configuration file.

## Workflow

1.- Open Visual Studio project and inmediatly hit `run`.

2.- [Disable `browser link` in case it's enabled](http://stackoverflow.com/a/23140874/1301872). It's just anoying.

3.- Once the project it's runnig up copy used port from the url.

4.- Open the windows console or powershell and navigate to `Content` directory.

5.- Run the command `npm start -- --port=<copied port>` to start `webpack-dev-server`.

6.- You should see an output like this in the console:

```sh
Î» npm start -- --port=51476

> aspnet-mvc-webpack-proxy-assets@0.1.0 start C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\aspnet-mvc-webpack-proxy-assets\Content
> babel-node ./webpack-dev-server.js "--port=51476"

Server running on http://localhost:6789
webpack built a80866ca4b28aeffcbcb in 11635ms
```

7.- Now open `http://localhost:6789` in the browser and enable the developer tools.

8.- You can see in the dev-tools console this message `[HMR] Waiting for update signal from WDS... [HMR] connected`, that means the Webpack Dev Server it's runnig with the Hot Module Replacement plugin.

At this point you can start modifying the code within `src` folder and `webpack` will handle all the changes to re-generate the bundles. It will also check for errors with ESLint and display them on both consoles, and sometimes in your face.

Most of the times webpack will try to re-generate the bundles without the need of reload the page, if not, webpack will let you know it and you just need to press the F5 key...

## What dependencies are added?

- [jquery@2.2.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery)
- [bootstrap@3.3.6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap)
- [font-awesome@4.5.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/font-awesome)

Webpack will help you to expose global variables like `$`, `jQuery` and `window.jQuery` to use it with modules, but **THEY WILL NOT BE IN THE GLOBAL SCOPE**.

```javascript
{
  plugins: [
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
      jQuery: 'jquery',
      $: 'jquery',
      'window.jQuery': 'jquery'
    })
  ]
}
```

## ESLint support

[ESLint](eslint.org) it's configured with the [`airbnb`](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb) preset and sets `$` and `jQuery` variables as globals.

```json
{
  "extends": "airbnb",
  "globals": {
    "$": true,
    "jQuery": true
  }
}
```

The code review runs everytime you save a file, so it will display information in the browser and both consoles if something weird happened with your code.

You can run the linter manually with the following command `npm run lint`.

## Vendor chuncks

All the third party dependencies will be bundled in one big (not so much) `vendor.js` file thanks to the `Commons Chunk` plugin.

```javascript
{
    new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin(
      'vendor', '[name].js'
    )
}
```

All the remained entries will be bundled according to the `output.filename` section of the `webpack.config.js` file.

## Generate bundles ready for production

Yes, you can, simply run `npm run build` and the `bundles` folder will apear with all the chuncks, _JavaScript files_, _CSS stylesheets_, _woff_, _ttf_, _svg_ and _eot_ fonts with _cool random names_ and more!

JavaScript and CSS files will have a source map file, they will be uglifyied and all the `debug` and `console.log` functions will be removed.

## Stripping unwanted code

Thanks to [Yahoo!](https://github.com/yahoo) for this simple but amazing loader: [`strip-loader`](https://github.com/yahoo/strip-loader). With it we can exclude unwanted functions like `debug` or `console.log`, I know, ESLint could warn us, but in case we forgot to remove someones here is how we can just drop out of our code.

### A little note about `strip-loader`

Beware of functions like this: `$('#learn-more').click(() => console.log('http://asp.net'));`, the console function it will not be removed, webpack is so smart that it will be transpile the code like this:

```javascript
$("#learn-more").click(function(){return console.log("http://asp.net")});
```

But if instead you use the code as follows

```javascript
$('#learn-more').click(() => {
  console.log('http://asp.net');
  window.open('http://asp.net', '_blank');
});
```

`strip-loader` will remove the `console.log`;

```javascript
$("#learn-more").click(function(){window.open("http://asp.net","_blank")});
```
